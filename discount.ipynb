    "## **Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "The program calculates the total discount a user can receive based on their total shopping amount and loyalty membership status. It applies tiered discounts depending on the total amount and adds an additional discount for loyalty members.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Discount Tiers:**\n",
    "- **20% discount** if the total amount exceeds **$500**.\n",
    "- **10% discount** if the total amount is between **$300** and **$500** (inclusive).\n",
